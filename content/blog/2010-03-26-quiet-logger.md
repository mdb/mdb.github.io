Given increasing enthusiasm for HTML5, as well as an interest in light-weight Wordpress themes, I created Quiet Logger, a minimal WordPress theme typeset in Baskerville and coded with HTML5.

## Features

* Semantically sound and valid HTML5
* Minimal, clean, and valid CSS 2.1
* HTML5 support to versions of Internet Explorer prior to IE 9 provided via Remy Sharpâ€™s HTML5 Shiv
* A minimal, typographically strong design based on Baskerville
* Free and licensed under GPL
