For the most part, each environment should be the same as the others, infrastructure-wise. However, there may also be necessary differences. For example:
a dev environment may consist of a single AWS region, while prod is composed of multiple AWS regions. prod&amp;rsquo;s us-west-2 region may require less compute redundancy than its us-east-1 region.</description></item></channel></rss>
