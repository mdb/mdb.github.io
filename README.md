### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I live in Philadelphia and work as a multi-disciplinary software engineer &
designer. I'm currently a software engineer on the [HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com/)
Strategic Global Infrastructure team.

Over the years, I've developed front end UIs, server backends, automated cloud
infrastructure provisioning, and built continuous deployment pipelines for highly
available applications. I like using and contributing to open source software.

I've also worked in graphic and UX design. Buy prints of my illustrations at
[Tiendah](https://tiendah.bigcartel.com).

[mikeball.info](http://mikeball.info) is my personal website and blog, featuring
over a decade of musings, lessons, and notes on technology.
