Naive to Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; support for custom controllers, the colleague hoped to proof-of-concept the idea via enhanced CI/CD pipeline logic that opaquely extended Kubernetes Deployment manifest YAML prior to each application deployment. As an alternative, the following offers an overview of the Kubernetes controller pattern, as well as a tour of a basic reference implementation.</description></item><item><title>What is the Kubernetes Operator Pattern?</title><link>/blog/what-is-the-kubernetes-operator-pattern/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/what-is-the-kubernetes-operator-pattern/</guid><description>An overview of the Kubernetes operator pattern and the use of custom resources and custom controllers in extending Kubernetes functionality.
What? Broadly speaking, Kubernetes operators seek to abstract, codify, and automate operational tasks beyond what out-of-the-box Kubernetes itself provides.
As summarized in the CNCF Operator Whitepaper:
In Kubernetes, an operator provides intelligent, dynamic management capabilities by extending the functionality of the API.
These operator components allow for the automation of common processes as well as reactive applications that can continually adapt to their environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
