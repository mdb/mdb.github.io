Books On Wheels is a Richmond, VA based nonprofit that offers youth development programs via bicycle repair education and free book distribution. I was responsible for front end design and development, as well as integrating the site to operate with WordPress serving as a content management system. The site features an event calendar, Flickr photo feed, and blog.
