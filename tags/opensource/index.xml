Our Philadelphia is a community website designed to provide information to Philadelphians about the role of money in local politics. The site features an address-based representative search tool, a news publishing platform, RSS feeds, user accounts and profiles, as well as an extensive database of local campaign donor information.</description></item></channel></rss>
