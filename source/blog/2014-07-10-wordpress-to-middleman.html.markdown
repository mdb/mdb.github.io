Many of the most prominent web technologies &mdash; Ruby on Rails, Django, Wordpress, Drupal, Express, Spring MVC &mdash; rely on a server-side language to process HTTP requests, appropriately query data, and serve back dynamically constructed HTML content. These platforms are great, yet developers of dynamic web applications often face complex performance challenges under heavy user traffic, independent of the underlying technology. High traffic &mdash; and frequent requests &mdash; may exploit processing-intensive code or network latency, in effect yielding a poor user experience or production outtage. Static site generators such as <a href="">middleman</a>, <a href="">jeckyll</a>, <a href="">wordsmith</a> offer developers an elegant alternative to complex dynamic web applications.
