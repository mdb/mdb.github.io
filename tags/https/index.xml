By setting the secure flag, an HTTP client — such as a web browser — prevents cookie transmission unless the response is securely encrypted over HTTPS.
However, many web applications redirect http:// to https://, and many Ruby on Rails applications are fronted by a web server such as Ngnix or Apache. Often, HTTPS is terminated at the Nginx/Apache layer.</description></item></channel></rss>
