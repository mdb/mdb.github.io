&lt;p&gt;Our Philadelphia is a community website designed to provide information to Philadelphians about the role of money in local politics. The site features an address-based representative search tool, a news publishing platform, RSS feeds, user accounts and profiles, as well as an extensive database of local campaign donor information. The project was made possible by the Samuel S. Fels Fund.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
