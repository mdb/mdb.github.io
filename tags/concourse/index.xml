Context and background Resources are a core concept in Concourse CI/CD pipelines. A resource is any entity that Concourse can check for new versions, fetch at a specific version, and/or push up changes to idempotently create new versions. In this sense, a resource &amp;ldquo;version&amp;rdquo; is a specific form of a resource that differs from earlier forms, such as a particular commit on a git repository or a particular build artifact object in an AWS S3 bucket.</description></item><item><title>Committing Via the Concourse Git Resource</title><link>/blog/committing-via-the-concourse-git-resource/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/committing-via-the-concourse-git-resource/</guid><description>A Concourse resource is any entity that can be checked for new versions, fetched at a specific version, and/or pushed up to idempotently create new versions. Concourse&amp;rsquo;s built-in git-resource is a Concourse resource for working with git repositories.
Pulling down a git repository for use in a pipeline job using the git-resource is fairly straight forward:
resources: - name: my-repo type: git source: branch: master uri: https://github.</description></item><item><title>Using the ConcourseCI pull request resource to verify Docker builds</title><link>/blog/using-the-concourseci-pull-request-resource-to-verify-docker-builds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/using-the-concourseci-pull-request-resource-to-verify-docker-builds/</guid><description>Concourse.ci offers a free, open source continuous integration and delivery tool through which software development teams can establish and manage delivery pipelines.
Problem: TravisCI can be configured to run CI against a docker image&amp;rsquo;s source code repository. But how can Concourse&amp;rsquo;s pull-request resource be configured to test that docker build of a Dockerfile works as expected in a repo that houses such a Dockerfile?
Solution: Configure the Concourse&amp;rsquo;s pull request verification job to use the docker-image resource type, thus performing a docker build using the Dockerfile during a pull request&amp;rsquo;s continuous integration.</description></item></channel></rss>
