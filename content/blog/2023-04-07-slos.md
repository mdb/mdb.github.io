Service level objectives -- SLOs -- are a mechanism for understanding and planning reliability.

## Definitions

* **service level indicator (SLI)** - a _key_ metric for a system that describes its operational health

  Example: the percentage of video starts that encounter an error

* **service level objective (SLO)** - a target for an SLI

  Example: 99.9% of video starts do not encounter an error

* **service level agreement (SLA)** - what happens when an SLO is met or missed

* **error budget** - the acceptable level of failure according to the SLO (100% - SLO)
