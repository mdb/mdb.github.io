My map of 2009 &ndash; 2012 complaints filed with the Philadelphia Police Advisory Commission won first place at the 2013 Barcamp News Innovation Hackathon.

The map plots the details surrounding complaints filed with the Police Advisory Commission by citizens against Philadelphia Police Officers. Its data is published by [Open Data Philly](http://www.opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/218/philadelphia-police-advisory-commission-complaints) and has been imported to a public [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aii0ITjxvJ6fdFlPNHVINHY2dVhfODNsY2JWU0U0NHc&usp=sharing#gid=0). According to Open Data Philly, the data comes directly from the Police Advisory Commission Complaint Database.

The map was built in an afternoon and uses Leaflet, Node.js, and Backbone. Its source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/mdb/phl-pac-complaint-browser).
