How are providers actually implemented? The following offers an outline of a brief presentation I gave to the HBO Max Strategic Global Infrastructure team.
Review of the basics First, let&amp;rsquo;s establish a foundation, especially for those who may be less familiar with Terraform.
Terraform fundamentals Terraform enables users to describe infrastructure resources &amp;ndash; and their dependency relationships &amp;ndash; in .tf files using HCL, and to automate the creation and ongoing management of that infrastructure via the Terraform command line inferface.</description></item><item><title>Using Terraform workspaces</title><link>/blog/using-terraform-workspaces/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/using-terraform-workspaces/</guid><description>Problem: In distributed software engineering, it&amp;rsquo;s common to maintain multiple named environments, each of which is a distinct, logical grouping of infrastructure resources. For example, utilizing separate production and pre-production environments (staging, development, etc.) is a traditional multi-tiered environment strategy in structuring a phased software build, test, and release lifecycle (or even a phased approach in deploying the software infrastructure itself). But how can a single Terraform configuration be used to safely manage infrastructure resources spanning multiple parallel environments?</description></item></channel></rss>
