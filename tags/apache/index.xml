&lt;p&gt;Solution: reduce the Apache &lt;code&gt;KeepAliveTimeout&lt;/code&gt; from its 15 second default (disclaimer: maybe, depending on circumstances).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP keep-alive functionality seeks to improve efficiency. In effect, HTTP keep-alive — also referred to as &lt;em&gt;HTTP persistent connection&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;HTTP connection reuse&lt;/em&gt; allows the use of a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests and responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep-alive reduces the latency associated with opening a new TCP connection for each HTTP request. It also reduces server CPU usage: by reusing an open connection, the server isn&amp;rsquo;t required to utilize CPU resources necessary to open a new TCP connection (and handle HTTPS, if relevant).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Secure Session Cookie in Rails over HTTPS</title><link>/blog/secure-session-cookie-in-rails-over-https/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/secure-session-cookie-in-rails-over-https/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The secure flag can be set by an application server when sending a cookie within an HTTP response. By setting the secure flag, an HTTP client — such as a web browser — prevents cookie transmission unless the response is securely encrypted over HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many web applications redirect &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt;, and many Ruby on Rails applications are fronted by a web server such as Ngnix or Apache. Often, &lt;code&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; is terminated at the Nginx/Apache layer. Given such an architecture, consider the following problematic behavior through which a Ruby on Rails session cookie could be transmitted insecurely in clear text:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
