The simple application leverages the New York Times API to visualize the differences in coverage offered to any two topics in any year between 1981 and 2013, in effect providing insight on the year-to-year relevancy of current events, as well as arguable editorial bias.
The application is built with Rails and Backbone.js.
TimesGrapher was built as a hobby project; it is not affiliated with the New York Times.</description></item><item><title>Philadelphia Police Advisory Commission Complaint Map</title><link>/projects/philadelphia-police-advisory-commission-complaint-map/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/philadelphia-police-advisory-commission-complaint-map/</guid><description>My map of 2009 â€“ 2012 complaints filed with the Philadelphia Police Advisory Commission won first place at the 2013 Barcamp News Innovation Hackathon.
