For example, utilizing separate production and pre-production environments (staging, development, etc.) is a traditional multi-tiered environment strategy in structuring a phased software build, test, and release lifecycle (or even a phased approach in deploying the software infrastructure itself). But how can a single Terraform configuration be used to safely manage infrastructure resources spanning multiple parallel environments?</description></item><item><title>Deploying Wordpress to Pagodabox</title><link>/blog/deploying-wordpress-to-pagodabox/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/deploying-wordpress-to-pagodabox/</guid><description>Services such as Heroku provide cloud deployment options for Rails, Sinatra, Django, and Node.js applications, but what about Wordpress?

Set up a local instance of Wordpress using MAMP There&amp;rsquo;s probably a fun way to do this with Vagrant, but MAMP will serve our purposes here.</description></item></channel></rss>
