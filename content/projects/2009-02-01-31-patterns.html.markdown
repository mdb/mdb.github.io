Nate Johnson, Kara Schlindwein, and I collaborated on this book of 31 illustrated patterns for Artclashâ€™s annual Fun-A-Day art show. We created one pattern each day throughout the month of January 2009 and compiled our finished work in a handmade book. The patterns are designed to tile infinitely.
