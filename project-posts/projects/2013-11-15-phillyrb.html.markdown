My team at Comcast Interactive Media is a Phillyrb sponsor. [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) designed a new [Philly.rb website](http://phillyrb.org), but organizers needed to auto-update the static site with the latest event information. Using JavaScript and Google Maps, I leveraged the Meetup.com API to auto-publish the next Philly.rb event to the site's homepage.
