MESS is the Django-based management software for West Philadelphiaâ€™s Mariposa food Co-op. I worked with a small team of developers to help plan and prototype the application. I was responsible for the branding and logo design, early prototyping, much of the initial interface concept and design, and much of the early front-end development. I continue to serve on the MESS team in my free time, working iteratively on feature requests and maintenance.

When I have time, I also help with some of Mariposa's Node.js-based software.
