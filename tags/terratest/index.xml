Problem You want to automate Terraform plan analysis in CI/CD, offsetting some of the manual toil associated with plan assessment. Tools like OPA offer policy-as-code solutions, but your team prefers to write Go.
Solution Usually, terratest is leveraged as a tool for authoring Terraform end-to-end tests that make post-terraform apply assertions on the correctness of the resulting infrastructure.
However, terratest can also be used to programmatically analyze Terraform plan output, effectively offering a Go-based alternative to tools like OPA and similar policy-as-code tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
