Solution: reduce the Apache KeepAliveTimeout from its 15 second default (disclaimer: maybe, depending on circumstances).
Background HTTP keep-alive functionality seeks to improve efficiency. In effect, HTTP keep-alive â€” also referred to as HTTP persistent connection and HTTP connection reuse allows the use of a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests and responses.
Keep-alive reduces the latency associated with opening a new TCP connection for each HTTP request.</description></item></channel></rss>
