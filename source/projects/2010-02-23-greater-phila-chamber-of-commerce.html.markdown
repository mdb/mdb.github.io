From August 2007 through March 2010, I served as Web Designer/Developer for the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. As Web Designer, I worked with the GPCC’s Web Team and Art Department to manage web presence, online branding, content architecture, and user experience. Throughout my time with the GPCC, I designed various web sites, web interfaces, features, functionality, and graphics for the GPCC and its affiliate organizations, working in XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, WordPress, PHP, MySQL, ASP.NET, and Adobe CS4 software.

While Jeremy Beaudry is responsible for greaterphilachamber.com’s original design, my contributions include enhanced typography and CSS styles, various icon sets, numerous web graphics, slideshows, a member bulletin board, an enhanced member directory, as well as various jQuery-based interaction enhancements.

As the GPCC's web presence grew significantly throughout my time as Web Designer, I also encouraged the organization’s adoption of various open source technologies, the most notable of which is the GPCC’s Linux web server, on which I installed and managed a LAMP stack hosting several sites and services.
