In the winter of 2009, I worked to redesign the BABC's website in conjunction with the organizationâ€™s new logo and branding. In addition to user interface design and front end development, I was also tasked with integrating the new site to work with WordPress serving as a content management system. The site features a blog, an event calendar, and dynamic JSON- and XML-powered Flickr image galleries.

Because the BABC had limited access to adequate hosting resources, I also installed Ubuntu Server Edition on a spare machine and configured a LAMP stack on which the site can run.
