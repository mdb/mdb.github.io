The simple application leverages the New York Times API to visualize the differences in coverage offered to any two topics in any year between 1981 and 2013, in effect providing insight on the year-to-year relevancy of current events, as well as arguable editorial bias.
The application is built with Rails and Backbone.js.
TimesGrapher was built as a hobby project; it is not affiliated with the New York Times.</description></item><item><title>Philadelphia Police Advisory Commission Complaint Map</title><link>/projects/philadelphia-police-advisory-commission-complaint-map/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/philadelphia-police-advisory-commission-complaint-map/</guid><description>My map of 2009 â€“ 2012 complaints filed with the Philadelphia Police Advisory Commission won first place at the 2013 Barcamp News Innovation Hackathon.

Casey Thomas, Dan Freiman, Adam Hinz, and I build Lobbying.ph as an entry in Code for America&amp;rsquo;s 2012 Civic Hackathon in Philadelphia. The project won first place.
Completed in about 5 hours, Lobbying.ph seeks to help Philadelphians access information about local lobbying efforts. As is reported on the site:
&amp;ldquo;Beginning in 2012, lobbyists and those paying for lobbyists in Philadelphia are required to register and file quarterly reports of their expenses with the City of Philadelphia Board of Ethics.</description></item></channel></rss>
