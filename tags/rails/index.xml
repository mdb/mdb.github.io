By setting the secure flag, an HTTP client — such as a web browser — prevents cookie transmission unless the response is securely encrypted over HTTPS.
However, many web applications redirect http:// to https://, and many Ruby on Rails applications are fronted by a web server such as Ngnix or Apache. Often, HTTPS is terminated at the Nginx/Apache layer.</description></item><item><title>TimesGrapher</title><link>http://mikeball.info/projects/timesgrapher/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mikeball.info/projects/timesgrapher/</guid><description>TimesGrapher seeks to shed light on what topics are covered by the New York Times from year-to-year. The simple application leverages the New York Times API to visualize the differences in coverage offered to any two topics in any year between 1981 and 2013, in effect providing insight on the year-to-year relevancy of current events, as well as arguable editorial bias.
The application is built with Rails and Backbone.js.
TimesGrapher was built as a hobby project; it is not affiliated with the New York Times.</description></item></channel></rss>
