Surround is a useful Vim plugin when hand-editing HTML or XML. The plugin can be downloaded via Github or the Vim website and installed by copying the /plugin/surround.vim file to your ~/.vim/plugin/ directory. A few of its basic commands are as follows. Note that each command is entered from within the text to be surrounded:

## Adding Surroundings

Generally, the cs or ys commands can be used to add surroundings.

Add Surrounding <tag> or Puncation to Word:

```
ysiw<tag>
csw<tag>
```

Add Surrounding to Highlighted Text From Within Visual Mode:

```
VS<tag>
```

Add Surrounding <tag> or Punctuation to Line:

```
yss<tag>
```

Add Surrounding to Line, Place it on a New Line, and Indent It:

```
ySs<tag>
ySS<tag>
```

## Changing Surroundings

Surroundings can be changed with the cs command.

Change Surrounding <tag>:

```
cst<newtag>
```

Change Surrounding Puncuation, in this Case Changing a Double Quote to a Single Quote:

```
cs"'
```

## Deleting Surroundings

Delete Innermost Surrounding <tag>:

```
dst
```

Delete Surrounding Quotes (Also works with parentheses, brackets, etc.):

```
ds"
```

Delete Text Within a <tag>

While this isn't a function of Surround.vim, I find it somewhat relevant to the above operations. Luckily, itâ€™s built into Vim.

```
dit
```
