While imperfect, Terraform does indeed often accommodate moderately complex logic. As a reference example, the following illustrates how Terraform constructs such as for_each, for/in, if, try, various functions, and custom local data structures can be used to successfully satisfy a relatively logic-intensive use case.
As a bonus, the reference example also teases some broader techniques for automating platform engineering across an organization.</description></item></channel></rss>
